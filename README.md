# 📚 Multi-File-Reader  
*A unified platform to read and manage multiple file types in one place.*

## 🚀 Overview
Modern users work with a variety of file types — PDF, EPUB, TXT, and more.  
Each format requires a different application to read, manage, or edit, which increases **RAM usage**, **storage consumption**, and complicates the user workflow.  

**Multi-File-Reader** solves this by allowing users to view and manage multiple file types inside a **single unified interface**, powered by distinctive file readers for each file format.  

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement
- Different file types require different apps to open (PDF apps, EPUB apps, text editors).  
- These apps consume resources and make file management inconvenient.  
- There is no centralized solution to read, organize, and manage files of multiple formats.  

**This project creates a unified, efficient, modern file-reading platform.**
